moby dick herman melville call me ishmael some years ago never mind
how long precisely having little or no money in my purse and
nothing particular to interest me on shore i thought i would sail
about a little and see the watery part of the world it
is a way i have of driving off the spleen and regulating
the circulation whenever i find myself growing grim about the mouth whenever
it is a damp drizzly november in my soul whenever i find
myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses and bringing up the rear of
every funeral i meet and especially whenever my hypos get such an
upper hand of me that it requires a strong moral principle to
prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street and methodically knocking peoples
hats off then i account it high time to get to sea
as soon as i can this is my substitute for pistol and
ball with a philosophical flourish cato throws himself upon his sword i
quietly take to the ship there is nothing surprising in this if
they but knew it almost all men in their degree some time
or other cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with
me there now is your insular city of the manhattoes belted round
by wharves as indian isles by coral reefs commerce surrounds it with
her surf right and left the streets take you waterward its extreme
down town is the battery where that noble mole is washed by
waves and cooled by breezes which a few hours previous were out
of sight of land look at the crowds of water gazers there
circumambulate the city of a dreamy sabbath afternoon go from corlears hook
to coenties slip and from thence by whitehall northward what do you
see posted like silent sentinels all around the town stand thousands upon
thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries some leaning against the
spiles some seated upon the pier heads some looking over the bulwarks
glasses of ships from china some high aloft in the rigging as
if striving to get a still better seaward peep but these are
all landsmen of week days pent up in lath and plaster tied
to counters nailed to benches clinched to desks how then is this
are the green fields gone what do they here but look here
come more crowds pacing straight for the water and seemingly bound for
a dive strange nothing will content them but the extremest limit of
the land loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not
suffice no they must get just as nigh the water as they
possibly can without falling in and there they stand miles of them
leagues inlanders all they come from lanes and alleys streets and avenues
north east south and west yet here they all unite tell me
does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all
those ships attract them thither once more say you are in the
country in some high land of lakes take almost any path you
please and ten to one it carries you down in a dale
and leaves you there by a pool in the stream there is
magic in it let the most absent minded of men be plunged
in his deepest reveries stand that man on his legs set his
feet a going and he will infallibly lead you to water if
water there be in all that region should you ever be athirst
in the great american desert try this experiment if your caravan happen
to be supplied with a metaphysical professor yes as every one knows
meditation and water are wedded for ever but here is an artist
he desires to paint you the dreamiest shadiest quietest most enchanting bit
